    <h1>Why Boycott Israeli Products?</h1>
    <p><strong>Boycotting Israeli products</strong> is a form of protest against <em>injustice and human rights
            violations</em>. The Palestinian people have been subjected to occupation, discrimination, and
        violence for decades. This boycott sends a message to companies and governments that support or benefit from these actions. It's a non-violent means to demand accountability and change.</p>
    <p><strong>Many multinational corporations</strong> operate in Israel or <em>profit from the occupation</em>. By
        boycotting their products, we decrease their financial support for unjust policies. Supporting the boycott aligns with international law and calls for the rights of Palestinians to be respected, including their right to self-determination. Individuals, organizations, and governments participate in boycotts to pressure Israel to end its occupation and colonization of Palestinian land.</p>
    <p><strong>It's essential</strong> to research products and avoid those with ties to Israeli companies or settlements in occupied territories. Understanding scientific facts, like the impact of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions on climate change, or historical events, as discussed in the 5<sup>th</sup> chapter of a relevant book, can empower individuals to make informed decisions.</p>
    <p><ins>Joining</ins> movements advocating for justice and peace is a tangible way to contribute to positive change, while <del>ignoring</del> the suffering of oppressed communities only perpetuates their plight. It's time to <s>turn a blind eye</s> and take a stand against injustice.</p>
    <p><strong>In conclusion</strong>, boycotting Israeli products is a peaceful and effective way to show solidarity with the Palestinian people and advocate for their rights.</p>
